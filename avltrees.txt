AVL Trees

1. AVL tree is a special case of BST. AVL tree has the additional property
that the difference of height between its left subtree and right subtree cannot
be greater than 1.

Some properties of AVL trees:
- if there are n nodes in AVL tree, minimum height of floor[log_{2}(n)]
- if there are n nodes in AVL tree, max height cannot exceed 1.44(log_{2}(n))
- given height of AVL tree is h, then the tree has max # of nodes to be 2^(h+1) - 1
- min # of ndoes in a tree with height h follows a recurrence relation:
    Numofnodes(h) = Numofnodes(h-1) + Numofnodes(h-2) + 1; N(0) = 1, N(1) = 2
- searching, inserting and deleting are all O(log n)
- level order traversal for AVL is O(n)

4 different rotations in AVL tree

1. left rotation (LL)
case:
        a
         \
          b
           \ 
            c

after rotating:
        b
       / \
      a   c

2. right rotation (RR)
case:
        a
       /
      b
     /
    c

after rotating:
        b
       / \
      c   a

3. left right rotation (LR) (double left)
- right rotation on right subtree
-left rotation on unbalanced root

4. right left rotation (RL) (double right)
- left rotation on left subtree
- right rotation on unbalanced root

Pseudocode for determining which rotation to use:

    // if tree is right heavy
            if right subtree is left heavy  
                do double left
            else
                do single left
        else if tree is left heavy
            if left sub tree is right heavy
                do double right
            else 
                do single right


//random scribble
pre order (root left right): 25 15 10 4 12 22 18 24 50 35 31 44 70 66 90  (has a general pattern of slanted L?)
in order (left root right):  4 10 12 15 18 22 24 25 31 35 44 50 66 70 90  (should give sorted seq)
post order (left right root): 4 12 10 18 24 22 15 31 44 35 66 90 70 50 25  (just weird)
    
preorder: stack
    push root
    while stack not empty
        pop and print
        push right
        push left

postorder: stack 
    while(root NOT null)
        (p root's right, p root, root = root->left)
    pop from stack
    root = the thing being popped
    if root has right child (which automatically follows that that right child is on stack top)
        pop right child
        push back root
        root = root->rightchild
    else    
        print root
        root = null
    go back to while loop while stack is NOT empty 


level order: queue
    0) enqueue root
    1) deque root
    2) p root->left, p root->right
    3) root = queue front
    4) step 1

inorder: stack
